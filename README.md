# Project11: A mapping focused open-sourced software framework for Autonomous Surface Vehicles

The Project 11 framework was developed as a backseat driver for Autonomous Surface Vehicles
(ASVs). Key design features include the ability to quickly and easily specify survey plans; monitoring of mission progress, even
over unreliable wireless networks; and to provide an environment to develop advanced autonomous technologies.
